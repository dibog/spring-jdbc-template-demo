== Introduction

There are many methods within the `JdbcTemplate` class of spring.

Here are some examples when to use which method.

You can build this document locally with
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package -Pdocumentation
----

You can find the generated file in `target/generated-docs/readme.html`.


== Queries

=== Query for exactly one entity
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{docdir}/src/test/java/io/dibog/spring/jdbc/QueryTest.kt[tags=query-single-entity,indent=0]
----
<1> `JdbcTemplate::queryForObject` expects to return *one* entity. It will throw an
`EmptyResultDataAccessException` if the query returns no entity or `IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException`
if it throws more than one entity.
<2> The SQL statement for the prepared statement.
<3> Parameter array for the prepared statement.
<4> The `RowMapper<T>` to be used to transform the result set into an entity.

=== Query for several entities
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{docdir}/src/test/java/io/dibog/spring/jdbc/QueryTest.kt[tags=query-multiple-entity,indent=0]
----
<1> `JdbcTemplate::query` expects to return zero to many entities.
<2> The SQL statement for the prepared statement.
<3> The `RowMapper<T>` to be used to transform the result set into an entity.

There is also another version of this method which takes an parameter array to
parameterize the prepared statement.

=== Query for one attribute of entities
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{docdir}/src/test/java/io/dibog/spring/jdbc/QueryTest.kt[tags=query-single-attribute,indent=0]
----
<1> `JdbcTemplate::queryForList` expects to return zero to more rows with one attribute.
<2> The SQL statement for the prepared statement selecting just one attribute.
<3> The kotlin type of the attribute to be part of the result list.

=== Query for several attributes of entities
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{docdir}/src/test/java/io/dibog/spring/jdbc/QueryTest.kt[tags=query-multiple-attribute,indent=0]
----
<1> `JdbcTemplate::queryForList` expects to return zero to more rows with attributes.
<2> The SQL statement for the prepared statement selecting just multiple attributes.

== Inserts with generated keys

In the following examples will be showed which inserts new rows into a table
where the `ID` attribute is automatically generated and returned. Returning
of generated keys is not supported for all JDBC drivers, so use it with care.

In the examples the image:http://hsqldb.org/images/hypersql_logo.png[HSQLDB,100,30,link=http://hsqldb.org] is used.

=== Inserting one entity the jdbc way
[source,kotlin]
----
include::{docdir}/src/test/java/io/dibog/spring/jdbc/InsertingEntitiesWithGeneratedIDsTest.kt[tags=inserting-single-entity-jdbc,indent=0]
----
<1> To be able to create the prepare statement ourself we need to use this method of `JdbcTemplate` to get a jdbc connection.
<2> This constructor calls creates a prepared statement which can return generated attributes of the insert.
You can either specify `Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS` to return any generated key of the insert,
or you can specify a StringArray containing the column names or an IntArray containing the column indices
of the returned generated key columns.
<3> The prepared statement parameters have to be set the usual jdbc way.
<4> The returned `Int` should contain the modified rows within the table. In the case of a single insert it should be `1`.
<5> The extension method `singleGeneratedKey` returns the generated key of the column `ID`. The `singleGeneratedKey`
method can be found in as extension method in the current project.


=== Inserting one entity the spring way

[source,kotlin]
----
include::{docdir}/src/test/java/io/dibog/spring/jdbc/InsertingEntitiesWithGeneratedIDsTest.kt[tags=inserting-single-entity-spring,indent=0]
----
<1> This object will contain after the query the generated key.
<2> Again this method is required to access the jdbc connection.
<3> Same as before we need to create the prepared statement with the correct constructor call.
<4> Again the parameters for the prepared statement have to be set the jdbc way.
<5> The keyholder into which the generated key will be inserted.
<6> After the call the to the JdbcTemplate query the key can be accessed via the keyholder.


Both methods seems to be of the same length or complexity.

=== Batch insert of multiple entities the jdbc way

The batch insert returning generated keys is not directly supported by the `JdbcTemplate`. In this project
you can find an extension function which supports the `GeneratedKeyHolder` of Spring.
----
include::{docdir}/src/test/java/io/dibog/spring/jdbc/InsertingEntitiesWithGeneratedIDsTest.kt[tags=inserting-multiple-entity-plain,indent=0]
----
<1> To be able to create the prepare statement ourself we need to use this method of `JdbcTemplate` to get a jdbc connection.
<2> This constructor calls creates a prepared statement which can return generated attributes of the insert.
You can either specify `Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS` to return any generated key of the insert,
or you can specify a StringArray containing the column names or an IntArray containing the column indices
of the returned generated key columns.
<3> The prepared statement parameters have to be set the usual jdbc way.
<4> The returned `Int` should contain the modified rows within the table. In the case of a single insert it should be `1`.
<5> The extension method `singleGeneratedKey` returns the generated key of the column `ID`. The `singleGeneratedKey`
method can be found in as extension method in the current project.

== Misc

=== Where conditions for checking membership in collections

Here an example for querying for an entity:

----
include::{docdir}/src/test/java/io/dibog/spring/jdbc/MiscTest.kt[tags=query-for-entitiy-in]
----

And here the same for querying for an attribute:

----
include::{docdir}/src/test/java/io/dibog/spring/jdbc/MiscTest.kt[tags=query-for-attribute-in]
